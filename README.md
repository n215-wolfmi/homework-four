This assignment was to take the home page created in the previous homework, homework-three, and to make it responsive. This assignment makes use of media queries and percentages with a focus on responsiveness and mobile friendly development.

I mainly focussed on percentages throughout the various elements in the page with a couple media queries to shift some items on the page around. As the page is made smaller, the items on the page gradually respond to the page movement because of the percentages added in the elements rather than hardcoding pixels into the definitions of width. The media queries help to move bigger items around where percentages can't prove useful.
